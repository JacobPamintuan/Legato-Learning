Legato Learning is the final culminating project for the ICS4U course. 

Legato Learning is an application designed to introduce musicians to the world of Music Theory.
Learn through the lessons provided and test your knowledge by completing the quizzes.
Track your Strengths and Weaknesses and review lessons and quizzes until you are confident.

I mainly focused on the UI and UX aspect rather than the complexity of the program. Using Figma for prototyping the GUI, I learned how having an clear prototype speeds up the coding process. As Java is not primarly built for front end development, it was a challenge to make it look as nice as it is using Java Swing. 
I took insparation from several learning websites like Duolingo and Quizlet when it came to how the user interacts with the progarm, and the different visual cues to help the user navigate though the UI seemlessly.

###### Home

After logging in or signimg up, you are first greeted by the home screen, based on the time frame that I was given, I decided to create only one course package, however it would not be that difficult to add a second or a third. Each course would have a profile photo, as well as a short description of the content. By clicking on a course, it would bring the user to the corresponding course page.

###### Course Page - Intervals

The course page is the portal to all the lessons and quizzes. In order to unlock the quizzes, the user must complete their respective lesson first. Completed lessons/quizzes are marked with a green checkmark, and locked quizzes are greyed out.

###### Sample lesson - Augmented and Diminished Intervals

The user can complete the lessons at their own pace. It is essentially a powerpoint presentation and the user navigates by pressing next or previous. Once completed, the user is directed back to the course page, and the corresponding quizzes are now unlocked.
