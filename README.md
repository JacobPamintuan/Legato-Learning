###### Legato Learning Login Page


Legato Learning is the final culminating project for the ICS4U course. 

Legato Learning is an application designed to introduce musicians to the world of Music Theory.
Learn through the lessons provided and test your knowledge by completing the quizzes.
Track your Strengths and Weaknesses and review lessons and quizzes until you are confident.

I mainly focused on the UI and UX aspect rather than the complexity of the program. Using Figma for prototyping the GUI, I learned how having an clear prototype speeds up the coding process. As Java is not primarly built for front end development, it was a challenge to make it look as nice as it is using Java Swing. 
I took insparation from several learning websites like Duolingo and Quizlet when it came to how the user interacts with the progarm, and the different visual cues to help the user navigate though the UI seemlessly.

You are first greeted by the home screen, based on the time frame that I was given, I decided to create only one course package, however it would not be that difficult to add a second or a third.
